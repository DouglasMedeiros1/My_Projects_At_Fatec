<h1>Portfolio of My Performance and Development in Fatec Projects</h1>

<h3>Introduction: </h3> 
<p>In this repository I plan to present a summary of personal projects and semester projects that I have developed and that I have been developing as a D.S.M. course. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cps.sp.gov.br/cursos-fatec/desenvolvimento-de-software-multiplataforma/">Multiplatform Software Development</a>)  at Fatec from São José dos Campos.</p>

<p>I'm currently studying the third semester of the course, and as I'm halfway through the course, it's now possible to get an overview of what was developed during this period.</p>

<br>
<b>My name is Douglas, I'm a 19-year-old developer who is learning about systems development in a practical way.</b> During these last three semesters I've been learning a lot about the world of programming, increasing my desire to develop complex systems and, at the same time, familiar to users.


<br />
<h4>Areas of Interest</h4>
<p>I have a great interest in various areas of technology, especially Web Development, Game Development and Artificial Intelligence. </p>

<h3 id="fatec">My experience at Fatec</h3>

<p>Since joining Fatec in 2023, I have been learning a lot about the development of object-oriented systems thanks to the Integrated Project Learning method, where it is possible to develop systems in a practical way, simulating real projects using agile methods. </p>

<p><b>Since the beginning of the course I was interested in occupying the position of Product Owner. </b> I was able to hold the position of Product Owner during the second and third semester, where I gained a lot of knowledge about the area and team management, in addition to obviously helping me manage the expectations of the client and the development team. </p>


<hr>
<br>
<h2 id="projects">My Projects</h2>


<p>As the Fatec de SJC DSM course uses the Integrated Project Learning method, it is common to deliver a complete project every semester, using agile methodology.</p>
<p>During the semester, there are 5 stages until the end of the project development, namely: 4 Sprints lasting 3 weeks each Kickoff, where we are presented with the proposal and the partner company that will be the client with whom we must align expectations and answer questions about the requirements, in addition to being the one who defines whether what was delivered in the Sprint meets the company's needs.   </p>

<br>

<h5>My Contributions: </h5>

<p>During the project development period, I was able to contribute to the development of the interface design. Because it is a short project and does not use minimally complex systems, individual work ended up becoming simple tasks, containing little or no difficulty.</p>

<p>During the last Sprint I had my best performance, where I was responsible for re-structuring the project screen that presented the team, the project proposal and our objectives.</p>

<br>

<h5>What I Learned During Development: </h5>

<p>- I was able to learn how to start working with Flask and Python, being able to learn about the structure of a system using Flask.</p>

<p>- Start learning how to style pages using Css, which despite being basic in design, can introduce me to the area.</p>

<p>- Discover and learn various HTML syntaxes used in large projects, gaining familiarity with the markup language</p>

<br>

<h5>My Contributions: </h5>

<p>During the development process I was able to occupy the position of frontend developer during the first 2 Sprints and I occupied the position of Product Owner in the second half of development, still doing frontend tasks. However, because the entire system was developed in Typescript, many tasks involved the involvement of several people, which facilitated development but ended up impeding individual progress. </p>

<p>During my period as a developer, I faced new challenges, as compared to the previous API this would be much greater. However, I managed to do what was proposed to me, delivering my activities with quality and always being interested in the team management process.</p>
<b>Therefore, when the group began to present difficulties in its management, I made myself available to become the Product Owner and becoming the former Product Owner and Scrum Master.<b/>

<p>Anyway, during the last two Sprints, we were able to correct the problems that we were bringing from the last Sprints and we were able to deliver a satisfactory delivery for both the client and the group</p>

<br><h5>What I Learned During Development: </h5>

<p>- I had more contact with languages ​​used in large Web systems projects</p>

<p>- I gained more familiarity with systems developed using Typescript, Node.js and React</p>

<p>⁣- I was able to manage the development team as Product Owner and looked for methods of documenting and managing a team</p>

<br>

<h5>My Contributions: </h5>

<p>In this project I developed systems on the frontend using Typescript and was once again able to occupy the position of Product Owner for 3 Sprints, as in the fourth Sprint the group had performance problems and needed to change roles.</p>

<p> With new members in the group, the management difficulty was greater, however, by not only participating but also defining the priorities and features of the system during the project kickoff, we were able to have a better definition of what and how it should be done.</p>

<b>As a Frontend developer I was able to greatly improve my knowledge of Typescript and React in an object-oriented system. Furthermore, by having a more isolated backend, as it was developed in Java, it was possible to further improve my individual skills, delivering interfaces that received approval and satisfaction from the client.<b/>


<br><h5>What I Learned During Development: </h5>

<p>- How to document the project development process in a clearer and more transparent way</p>

<p>- New skills in defining deadlines, deliveries, priorities and managing client and development team expectations</p>

<p>- Improving my skills in developing object-oriented systems</p>
